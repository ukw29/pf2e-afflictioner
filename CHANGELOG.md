## [1.0.0-alpha.2] - 2026-02-14

### Added

- **Curse Affliction Support**: Full support for curse afflictions alongside poisons and diseases
  - Curse trait detection and parsing
  - Updated all UI elements to handle curses
  - Updated language strings and documentation

- **Virulent Trait (Official PF2e Rules)**:
  - Properly implements the virulent trait per Core Rulebook rules
  - Requires **two consecutive successful saves** to reduce stage by 1
  - Critical success reduces stage by only 1 (instead of 2)
  - Tracks consecutive success counter across saves
  - Shows notification when first success is achieved
  - Resets counter on failures or critical successes
  - UI badge shows `[Virulent]` with tooltip in Affliction Manager
  - Chat messages display virulent trait status and mechanics

- **Multiple Exposure (Official PF2e Rules)**:
  - **Poisons** (default behavior):
    - Failing initial save against new exposure increases stage by 1 (or 2 on critical failure)
    - Maximum duration remains unchanged
    - Works even during onset period (doesn't change onset length)
    - If no onset or already elapsed, immediately applies new stage effects
  - **Curses & Diseases** (default behavior):
    - Multiple exposures have no effect
    - Shows notification when re-exposed
  - **Custom Multiple Exposure Rules**:
    - Parses affliction-specific multiple exposure rules from item descriptions
    - Recognizes patterns like "Each additional exposure advances the stage by 2"
    - Supports minimum stage requirements (e.g., "when already at stage 2 or higher")
    - Custom rules override default behavior for all affliction types
  - UI badge shows `[Multiple Exposure +X]` with stage increase amount

- **UI Enhancements**:
  - Affliction Manager displays trait badges for virulent and multiple exposure
  - Chat save prompts show virulent trait warnings and mechanics
  - Tooltips explain trait effects on hover
  - Color-coded badges (virulent: orange, multiple exposure: blue)

- **New Language Strings**:
  - `MULTIPLE_EXPOSURE_NO_EFFECT_DEFAULT`: For curse/disease re-exposure
  - `POISON_RE_EXPOSURE`: For poison stage increase notification
  - `VIRULENT_CONSECUTIVE_SUCCESS`: First successful save against virulent affliction

### Changed

- Updated all trait detection logic to include curse trait
- Updated `AFFLICTION_TYPES` constant to include `CURSE: 'curse'`
- Revised README.md to accurately describe PF2e affliction mechanics
- Updated settings hint to mention curse detection

### Technical Details

- **AfflictionParser.js**:
  - Added `extractMultipleExposure()` method to parse custom rules
  - Enhanced `parseFromItem()` to detect virulent and curse traits
  - Updated structured affliction parsing for curse support

- **AfflictionService.js**:
  - Added `handlePoisonReExposure()` for default poison behavior
  - Modified `handleInitialSave()` to detect and handle re-exposure
  - Updated `handleStageSave()` to implement two-consecutive-saves for virulent
  - Added `findExistingAffliction()` helper method
  - Added `virulentConsecutiveSuccesses` counter to affliction data

- **AfflictionManager.js**:
  - Updated `_prepareContext()` to pass trait flags to template
  - Added `isVirulent`, `hasMultipleExposure`, and `multipleExposureIncrease` properties

- **Templates**:
  - Updated `affliction-manager.hbs` to display trait badges

- **Hooks & Dialogs**:
  - Updated all curse/disease/poison detection in `registration.js`
  - Updated `AddAfflictionDialog.js` for curse item handling
