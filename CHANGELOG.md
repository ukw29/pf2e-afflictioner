# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.2.2] - 2026-02-24

### Added

- **Player weapon coating**: Players can now coat their own weapons with injury poisons and use the Envenom/Vishkanya flow directly from chat buttons, without requiring GM intervention. The "Coat Weapon" button appears for any user who owns the speaker's actor.

### Fixed

- **Attack roll target detection**: Fixed coated weapon hit detection always showing "No targets selected" because it read the GM's targets instead of the actual attack target. Now extracts the target from PF2e's message flags embedded in the attack roll.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-02-24

### Fixed

- **Chinese speed penalty parsing**: Added locale-aware speed penalty pattern (`速度-N尺状态减值`) to the Chinese parser locale, and refactored `AfflictionEffectBuilder` to use locale-driven `speedPenaltyPatterns` instead of a hardcoded English regex.

- **Apply Consequences button crash**: Fixed `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'get')` error on `canvas.tokens` when the button is rendered before the canvas is fully initialised.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-24

### Added

- **Vishkanya ancestry feat support**: The "Coat Weapon" button now appears on chat cards for the Envenom action and all Enhance Venom feat actions (Lesser, Moderate, Greater). Venom tier and damage are determined automatically from the actor's feats (base 1d4, lesser 1d6/2d6, moderate 3–5d6, greater 7–11d6). The Vicious Venom feat marks the venom as virulent. The Debilitating Venom feat prompts a choice of Hampering (–5/–10ft Speed penalty) or Stumbling (Off-Guard on stages 2–3) before coating. Envenom venom is not consumed on use.
- **Blowgun Poisoner feat support**: When an attacker with the Blowgun Poisoner feat critically succeeds at a blowgun Strike with a coated or innate-note poison, the target's initial Fortitude save is treated as one degree worse.
- **Fast Recovery feat support**: When a character with Fast Recovery succeeds at a stage save against a disease or poison, the affliction regresses by 2 stages (1 on a critical success it regresses by 3; virulent afflictions reduce those values by 1). Fast Recovery bypasses the virulent consecutive-successes mechanic.

## [1.1.10] - 2026-02-23

### Added

- **Token Tools button mode**: New setting "Use Token Tools Button" moves the Affliction Manager button from the Token HUD to the Scene Controls token tools sidebar. The button appears only when a token is selected, glows red with a pulsing animation when the selected token has active afflictions, and updates in real time as afflictions are added or removed.

### Fixed

- **Show Visual Indicators now controls the monitor panel**: The "Show Visual Indicators" setting now correctly hides the affliction monitor panel (floating corner widget) when turned off, in addition to the token tint it already controlled.
- **Show Visual Indicators description corrected**: The setting hint now accurately describes what it controls — a red tint on afflicted tokens and the monitor panel — replacing the incorrect "biohazard icon" wording.

## [1.1.9] - 2026-02-23

### Added

- **Simplified Chinese locale**: Affliction descriptions from the PF2e CN community pack are now parsed correctly — stage headers, onset, duration units, condition names, damage types, and weakness phrases are all matched against their Chinese equivalents.

### Fixed

- **Chinese stage parsing — optional space**: Stage headers written without a space between the label and number (e.g. `阶段1` instead of `阶段 1`) are now recognised correctly.
- **Chinese stage duration — full-width parentheses**: Stage durations enclosed in full-width brackets `（1轮）` are now parsed correctly alongside the standard ASCII form `(1 round)`.

## [1.1.8] - 2026-02-23

### Added

- **Token Tools button mode**: New setting "Use Token Tools Button" that moves the Affliction Manager button from the Token HUD to the Scene Controls token tools sidebar. When enabled, the biohazard button appears only when a token is selected and glows red when the selected token has active afflictions.

## [1.1.7] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed

- **Missing conditions in stage editor**: Concealed, Controlled, Encumbered, Hidden, Invisible, Observed, Off-Guard, Petrified, Quickened, and Undetected are now available in the condition dropdown when manually editing affliction stages.

## [1.1.6] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed

- **Treatment and counteract prompts are now public**: The "Roll Medicine" and counteract roll buttons are no longer whispered — they post as public chat messages so any player can see and use them to perform the check on behalf of the afflicted character.

- **Inline roll damage parsing**: Content using the `[[/r 1d6[poison]]]` inline roll syntax (e.g. Kingmaker module) now correctly parses damage, matching the behaviour of the `@Damage[1d6[poison]]` format.
- **`Flat-Footed` condition alias**: The condition name `Flat-Footed` (same UUID as `Off-Guard`) is now mapped to `off-guard` during parsing, so it is correctly applied as a stage condition.

## [1.1.5] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed

- **Weapon coating consumes a poison dose**: Coating a weapon via the chat button or the Affliction Manager now decrements the poison item's quantity by one. If it was the last dose, the item is deleted.

## [1.1.4] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **Coat Weapon dialog includes targeted tokens' weapons**: Weapons from currently targeted tokens are now shown alongside the speaker's weapons, grouped by actor with a section header for each. Allows coating a friendly's weapon by targeting them before clicking the button.

## [1.1.3] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed

- **Coat Weapon dialog now only shows the speaker's weapons**: The weapon selection dialog triggered by the "Coat Weapon" chat button no longer lists weapons from all canvas tokens — it filters to only the actor/token that sent the item card.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed

- **Persistent conditions now survive stage changes and affliction end**: Conditions with natural duration or self-modifying behavior (`frightened`, `drained`, `stunned`, `doomed`, `wounded`) are now applied as real condition items instead of being tied to the affliction effect — they persist after stage transitions and after the affliction ends, as per PF2e rules. Stage-tied conditions (`clumsy`, `paralyzed`, etc.) continue to be removed when the stage changes.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed

- **Coating deferred until GM confirms**: Injury poison coating is no longer spent on hit detection — it is now removed only when the GM clicks the "Apply Affliction" button in the whisper message, allowing the GM to decline without losing the coating

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **Weapon Coating**: Injury poisons can now be applied to weapons directly from the Affliction Manager
  - New **Weapon Coatings** tab in the Affliction Manager (tab-based navigation)
  - Shows all piercing/slashing weapons for the selected token; each row has an inline poison selector
  - Coating data persisted as actor flags (`pf2e-afflictioner.weaponCoatings`)
  - **"Coat Weapon" button** injected on injury-poison item cards in chat (GM only)
  - On first Strike with a coated weapon the module auto-detects the outcome:
    - **Hit (piercing/slashing)**: poison spent, GM receives a whisper with "Apply Affliction" button
    - **Miss**: poison remains on weapon, GM notified
    - **Critical miss or non-piercing/slashing hit**: poison spent with no effect
  - Hover tooltip on active coating shows DC, onset, max duration, and per-stage effects
  - Info button (ⓘ) next to poison name opens the item sheet
  - All user-facing strings fully i18n-localised under `PF2E_AFFLICTIONER.WEAPON_COATING`

## [1.0.3] - 2026-02-21

### Fixed

- **Affliction Manager Crash on Open**: Fixed `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '-2')` when opening the Affliction Manager with afflictions awaiting initial save (`currentStage === -1`) or with missing `stages` data
  - `currentStage - 1` evaluates to `-2` when awaiting initial save, which crashed when `stages` was `undefined`
  - Stage index lookup now guards both `stageIndex >= 0` and `aff.stages` being defined before array access
  - `hasWarning` reuses the already-safe local `currentStage` variable instead of re-indexing
  - `canProgressStage` uses `aff.stages?.length ?? 0` to avoid crashing on undefined stages

### Changed

- **Full i18n Coverage**: All hard-coded user-visible strings replaced with `game.i18n` calls, making the module fully localizable
  - Added ~100 new localization keys across new sections (`CHAT`, `MONITOR`) and additions to `MANAGER`, `BUTTONS`, `ERRORS`, `EDITOR`, `DIALOG`, `CONFLICT`, `NOTIFICATIONS`, and `SETTINGS`
  - All module settings `name` and `hint` strings now use i18n keys (Foundry localizes them automatically)
  - Chat message templates (save requests, stage changes, death confirmation, re-exposure, max duration) now use `game.i18n.format()`
  - Token HUD tooltip, notification messages, button labels, and dialog content all localized
  - Affliction Monitor Indicator tooltip strings (onset, initial save, save countdown, stage display) localized
  - Degree-of-success labels in counteract confirm button now use `DEGREES.*` keys
  - No behavior changes — purely a localization coverage improvement

## [1.0.2] - 2026-02-20

### Fixed

- **Affliction Button Injection**: "Apply Affliction to Target" button now injects after the last roll note instead of the first, placing it correctly below the affliction description
  - "Apply to Target / Selected Token" button no longer appears on items with no stages (e.g. Dread Ampoule)
- **Skip No-Stage Afflictions**: Affliction processing loops now skip afflictions with no stages, preventing unnecessary processing of non-affliction items
- **Septic Malaria DC Parsing**: DC now correctly extracted from rendered note HTML (`data-pf2-dc`) for NPC action-type afflictions where DC is not stored on the item
- **Structured Affliction Duration**: Stage durations from structured PF2e affliction items now normalize plural unit strings (e.g. `"days"` → `"day"`) to match duration multiplier keys, fixing duration tracking

### Changed

- **Applied Button State**: "Apply Affliction to Target" button now shows a check-circle icon and muted red styling after being clicked

## [1.0.1] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- **Community Afflictions Auto-Import**: Bundled community affliction definitions are now automatically imported on world load
  - Compares bundled data version against last imported version
  - Auto-merges new entries without conflicts
  - Shows conflict resolution dialog when GM edits overlap with community data
  - Tracks import version via `communityDataVersion` setting

### Changed

- **Removed Default DC Setting**: Afflictions without a parseable DC now warn the GM via notification instead of silently falling back to a configurable default
  - Added `NO_DC_FOUND` notification: "No DC found for affliction item {itemName}"
  - Prevents incorrect DCs from being used unknowingly

- **Visual Indicator Setting Scope**: Changed "Show Visual Indicators" setting from client to world scope

### Fixed

- **Storyframe Integration**: Rolls sent through Storyframe now work correctly with the save confirmation system
  - Removed unnecessary participant requirement — requests now use actor UUID and user ID directly
  - Save results route through SocketService with the roll message ID, enabling "Apply Consequences" button injection
  - Added fallback to find roll message by actor and total when `chatMessageId` is unavailable

## [1.0.0-alpha.10] - 2026-02-19

### Changed

- **NPC Saves are Blind GM Rolls**: NPC affliction saves now automatically roll as blind GM rolls
  - Both initial saves and stage saves use `CONST.DICE_ROLL_MODES.BLIND` for NPC actors
  - Players never see NPC save rolls or results in chat

- **NPC Save Messages Whispered to GM**: Save request messages for NPCs now whispered to GM instead of posted publicly
  - Both initial save and stage save prompts whispered when actor has no player owner
  - Prevents players from seeing NPC affliction save prompts

- **Apply to Target / Selected Token**: Button now prioritizes user targets over selected tokens
  - Checks `game.user.targets` first, falls back to `canvas.tokens.controlled`
  - Button label updated to "Apply to Target / Selected Token"

### Fixed

- **Spell DC Parsing**: Afflictions from spells now extract DC from the chat message save button when the item has no DC
  - Spells have dynamic DCs not stored on the item — now parsed from `data-dc` in message content
  - Prevents afflictions from falling back to the default DC setting

- **Storyframe Participant Prompt Removed**: Storyframe integration now silently falls back to chat buttons when actor is not a participant
  - Previously prompted GM to add actor as participant, blocking the flow

## [1.0.0-alpha.9] - 2026-02-18

### Fixed

- **Counteract: Multiple Spellcasting Entries**: Characters with multiple spellcasting entries of the same tradition (e.g., Wizard + Magus archetype, class spells + innate spells) now all appear individually in the counteract check type dropdown
  - Previously deduplicated by tradition, showing only one "Arcane Spellcasting" option even with multiple arcane entries
  - Now lists each entry by name (e.g., "Arcane Spells", "Arcane Innate Spells") using the entry's unique ID
  - Rolling uses the exact selected entry's statistic for accurate modifiers
  - Backward compatible with existing counteract buttons in chat history

## [1.0.0-alpha.8] - 2026-02-18

### Added

- **"Dead" Stage Support**: Affliction stages with "dead" effect now prompt GM for confirmation before killing character
  - GM receives whispered chat message with "Confirm Kill" button
  - On approval: sets character HP to 0 and applies the Dead condition
  - Prevents accidental kills with explicit GM confirmation step

- **"As Stage X" Reference Support**: Stages referencing another stage (e.g. "as stage 2") now inherit that stage's damage, conditions, and effects
  - Referenced stage's damage, conditions, and weakness are copied automatically
  - Own duration and raw text are preserved

- **Week Duration Unit**: Added "week" as a valid duration unit for onset, stage duration, and max duration fields

- **Application Initiative Setting**: New "Use Application Initiative" world setting
  - When enabled, affliction saves trigger on the initiative step the affliction was first applied rather than the afflicted token's own initiative
  - Unofficial rule — not explicitly in the PF2e rulebook, off by default

### Fixed

- **Persistent Damage Conditions**: Persistent damage now applied directly on the actor instead of via GrantItem
  - GrantItem cannot represent persistent damage with formula/type, causing it to be silently skipped
  - Uses `game.pf2e.ConditionManager` to create a proper persistent-damage condition with correct formula, damage type, and recovery DC
  - Old persistent damage is removed before applying a new stage and on affliction removal
  - Tooltip and chat messages now display persistent damage correctly (e.g. "1d6 fire persistent damage")

- **Valueless Conditions**: On/off conditions (blinded, paralyzed, prone, etc.) no longer show a numeric value field in the stage editor

- **Condition Name Validation**: Condition names with spaces (e.g. "persistent damage") now validate correctly against hyphenated slug form

## [1.0.0-alpha.7] - 2026-02-18

### Added

- **Dynamic Stage Duration Rolling**: Dice-based stage durations (e.g. "Paralyzed for 2d4 hours") now roll automatically on stage entry
  - Rolls posted as GM-whispered chat message with dice formula and result
  - ui.notifications toast also shown
  - Rolled value persisted to affliction store so subsequent saves use the correct duration
  - Supports Foundry inline roll notation `[[/br 2d4 #hours]]` in addition to plain text

- **Max Duration Effect Expiry**: When an affliction hits max duration and GM clicks "Remove", the Foundry effect is now updated to the stage's rolled duration so conditions expire naturally rather than persisting indefinitely
  - Only applies if the current stage had a timed duration (e.g. Paralyzed for 2d4 hours)
  - Stages without explicit duration continue existing behavior (effect remains until manually removed)

- **Counteract: Spellcasting Proficiency**: Counteract check type dropdown now includes spellcasting traditions
  - **Arcane / Divine / Occult / Primal Spellcasting** options listed first (ability mod + proficiency, per PF2e rules)
  - Auto-detected from the caster's spellcasting entries when available
  - Rolls via `spellcastingEntry.statistic.check.roll()` for accurate modifier
  - Falls back to relevant knowledge skill (arcana/religion/etc.) if no matching entry found
  - Skills still available as fallback

- **Counteract: Apply Consequences Button**: When "Require Save Confirmation" is enabled, counteract rolls now inject an "Apply Counteract Consequences" button directly onto the roll message (matching the save confirmation pattern)
  - Button color-coded by degree of success
  - Shows rank explanation (e.g. "Can counteract up to rank 4 — affliction rank 3 is within range")
  - Button omitted entirely on failure/critical failure when counteract cannot succeed
  - Supports hero point rerolls — degree recomputed from live roll each render
  - Uses `pf2e.preReroll` hook to copy flags to new message on reroll

- **Counteract: Spell Rank as Default**: Counteract rank dialog now defaults to the spell's cast rank (per PF2e rule: spell rank = counteract rank)

### Fixed

- **Dynamic Stage Duration**: Fixed `Roll.evaluate({ async: false })` removed in Foundry v12 causing stage duration rolls to silently fail
  - Now uses `await roll.evaluate()` with Math.random fallback
  - All call sites updated to properly `await` the async method

- **Foundry Enrichment Parsing**: Stage durations using Foundry inline roll notation (`[[/br 2d4 #hours]]`) now parse correctly
  - Previous plain-text regex failed on enriched descriptions
  - New `stripEnrichment()` helper also added for general use

- **Edited Definition Override**: Fixed edited affliction definitions overwriting freshly-parsed stage durations with stale null values
  - Edited definitions stored before the parsing fix had null durations that silently replaced correct values

- **Counteract Apply Button**: Fixed "Apply Counteract Consequences" button doing nothing when injected asynchronously
  - Button now has event listener attached directly at injection time (not via `registerCounteractButtonHandlers`)

### [1.0.0-alpha.6] - 2026-02-17

### Added

- **Anonymize Save Messages Setting**: New GM setting to hide affliction details from players
  - New world setting: "Anonymize Save Messages"
  - When enabled, players only see "Fortitude Save Required" without affliction name or details
  - Hides affliction name, exposure text, current stage, and virulent trait information
  - Players still see DC (if PF2e metagame setting allows) and treatment bonuses
  - GMs continue to see full details in their separate GM-only messages
  - Useful for keeping the nature of afflictions secret from players
  - Works for both initial saves and stage saves

- **Unidentified Affliction Effects**: Affliction effects are now automatically unidentified for players when mysterious
  - Effects appear as "Unknown Affliction" to players when the affliction's nature is unknown
  - Automatically unidentified when:
    - Affliction is currently in onset period (not yet affecting the character), OR
    - Current stage has no mechanical effects (no conditions, weakness, or damage)
  - Automatically identified when:
    - Character experiences mechanical effects (conditions, weakness, or damage)
  - Once identified, stays identified even if character regresses to earlier stages
  - Effect text alone (flavor text) does NOT reveal the affliction's identity
  - GMs always see the true affliction name
  - Prevents meta-gaming by hiding affliction details until they become mechanically apparent

- **Onset Effects with Duration**: Onset effects now show countdown timer
  - Onset effects display actual onset duration (e.g., "10 MINUTES REMAINING")
  - Duration automatically counts down using Foundry's built-in timer system
  - Description shows simple "Onset" text (no redundant time information)
  - Stages continue to use unlimited duration (they end via saves, not time)

- **GM Rolls Mysterious Initial Saves**: New setting for complete secrecy with mysterious afflictions
  - New world setting: "GM Rolls Mysterious Initial Saves"
  - When enabled, GM rolls initial saves in secret for mysterious afflictions
  - Mysterious affliction criteria:
    - Affliction has an onset period, OR
    - Stage 1 has no mechanical effects (no conditions, weakness, or damage)
  - Players never see the save request - complete secrecy maintained
  - **Rolls are automatically made as blind GM rolls** - players don't see roll or result
  - Temporarily sets roll mode to blind, skips dialog, then restores original mode
  - GM receives special message with red border and secret icon
  - Indicates reason for secrecy (onset or no mechanical effects)
  - Works with "Anonymize Save Messages" and unidentified effects for maximum mystery

### Changed

- **Effect Timing**: Effects now only appear after initial save completes
  - No effect created during "Awaiting initial save" state
  - Effect appears when character enters onset or first stage
  - Reduces clutter and confusion during initial exposure

- **Badge Numbering**: Badge range changed from 0-max to 1-max
  - Onset effects have no badge (onset is not a numbered stage)
  - Stage effects show badge numbered 1 to max stage
  - Prevents confusion with badge value 0

### Fixed

- **Initial Save Effect Deletion**: Fixed effect being deleted when closing sheet during initial save
  - Added check to skip badge sync when affliction is awaiting initial save
  - Prevents premature affliction removal from badge normalization

- **Blind Roll Implementation**: GM secret saves now properly use blind roll mode
  - Temporarily sets core roll mode to blind before rolling
  - Skips dialog to prevent mode override
  - Restores original roll mode after roll completes
  - Ensures players never see the roll or result in chat

### Refactored

- **AfflictionService Code Organization**: Major refactor splitting monolithic service into focused modules
  - Created **AfflictionEffectBuilder** (374 lines) - Effect creation, updates, and configuration
  - Created **AfflictionChatService** (375 lines) - Chat message generation and prompts
  - Created **AfflictionTimerService** (217 lines) - Duration tracking and timing logic
  - Reduced **AfflictionService** from 1580 lines to 818 lines (-48% reduction)
  - Total code extracted: 966 lines into 3 focused services
  - **Benefits:**
    - Single Responsibility Principle - each service has clear focus
    - DRY Compliance - eliminated all duplicated logic
    - Improved testability - services can be tested independently
    - Better maintainability - changes are isolated to specific services
    - Cleaner imports - each service only imports what it needs
  - **Zero behavior changes** - pure code organization refactor
  - All code passes linting with no errors

## [1.0.0-alpha.5] - 2026-02-17

### Added

- **Condition Protection System**: Prevents manual removal or modification of affliction-managed conditions
  - New hook system to intercept condition deletion and updates
  - Players cannot manually remove or modify conditions applied by afflictions
  - Conditions show lock icon in UI to indicate they are protected
  - Prevents players from bypassing affliction mechanics by removing conditions directly
  - Module code uses bypass flags to allow proper cleanup during stage changes

- **GM Manual Stage Control**: GMs can manually adjust affliction stages via badge value
  - Click the badge number on affliction effects to directly change the stage
  - Setting badge to 0 removes the affliction (cures the character)
  - Automatically updates all stage effects, conditions, and bonuses
  - Properly cleans up condition instances from stacking service
  - Removes visual indicators when affliction is cured

- **GM Condition Level Override**: GMs can manually adjust condition values
  - Allows GMs to manually increase or decrease affliction-managed condition levels
  - Useful for story adjustments or correcting errors
  - Non-GMs are prevented from modifying to maintain affliction integrity

- **Maximum Duration UI**: Added affliction editor field for maximum duration
  - New UI field to manually set or adjust maximum duration
  - Toggle button to add/remove maximum duration (makes affliction indefinite when removed)
  - Supports rounds, minutes, hours, and days
  - Backend tracking and parsing was already implemented in v1.0.0-alpha.3

- **Maximum Duration Chat Notifications**: GMs receive chat messages with removal button when max duration expires
  - Whispered chat message when affliction reaches maximum duration
  - **Requires GM confirmation** - Affliction is NOT auto-removed, button provided for manual removal
  - **Conditions persist** after removal (per PF2e rules) - must be removed separately
  - Shows the stage at expiration and duration that was reached
  - Button to remove affliction while preserving conditions
  - Respects official PF2e rule: "conditions persist and must be removed through other means"

- **Live Affliction Updates**: Edited affliction changes now apply to active afflictions immediately
  - When saving affliction editor changes, updates all matching active afflictions on canvas
  - Updates DC, save type, maximum duration, stages, and traits
  - Preserves current stage and progression state
  - Re-applies current stage effects with updated definition
  - Shows notification with count of updated afflictions
  - Ensures active afflictions immediately reflect edited values

- **Save Confirmation Setting**: New "Require Save Confirmation" world setting to prevent meta-gaming
  - When enabled, GM must confirm save results before consequences are applied
  - Allows players to use hero points or other reroll abilities after seeing the roll result
  - Shows roll result and degree of success (Critical Success/Success/Failure/Critical Failure) in chat
  - **Button injected directly onto roll message** - No separate confirmation message needed
  - Button appears below the roll result with color-coded border matching degree of success
  - Consequences (conditions, stage changes) only apply after GM clicks "Apply Consequences"
  - **Automatic Reroll Update**: Uses `pf2e.preReroll` and `pf2e.reroll` hooks
  - When player rerolls, button automatically updates with new result and degree
  - Button color changes to match new degree (green→orange for success→failure)
  - No separate messages - everything stays on the original roll message
  - Stores roll message ID (not result value) so button always applies latest outcome
  - Player can reroll multiple times - button always shows current result
  - GM-only feature - prevents revealing success/failure through immediate consequence application
  - Works for both initial saves and stage saves

### Fixed

- **Condition Cleanup on Cure**: Fixed conditions not being removed when affliction is cured
  - Now properly removes condition instances from ConditionStackingService
  - Recalculates conditions to update or remove displayed conditions
  - Ensures no orphaned conditions remain after affliction removal

- **Maximum Duration Saving**: Fixed maximum duration not being saved in affliction editor
  - Affliction editor now properly saves maxDuration field when form is submitted
  - Fixed Foundry v13+ flat form data structure handling for maxDuration fields
  - Maximum duration changes are now persisted to edited affliction definitions

- **Maximum Duration Unified Tracking**: Fixed max duration to work correctly across combat and world time
  - Previously used separate tracking systems that didn't account for mode transitions
  - Combat tracking used stage start round instead of affliction start time
  - World time tracking didn't account for combat rounds
  - Now uses unified `maxDurationElapsed` counter that accumulates time in seconds
  - Combat: Adds 6 seconds per round to counter
  - World Time: Adds delta seconds to counter
  - **Correctly starts counting AFTER onset completes** (per PF2e rules, not during onset)
  - Properly handles afflictions that transition between combat and exploration mode
  - Example: Onset 10 minutes → max duration counting starts after onset → Affliction lasts onset + max duration

- **Initial Save Permission Error**: Fixed bug where non-GM players rolling initial saves would trigger "Only GMs can manage afflictions" error
  - Initial saves now properly use socket communication to send results to GM for processing
  - Prevents desync between active effects and affliction manager
  - Matches existing stage save behavior for consistent multi-user support

- **Curse Detection**: Improved "Apply Affliction" button detection for curses with non-standard formatting
  - Previously only detected afflictions with "Saving Throw" AND ("Stage 1" OR "Stage 2") text pattern
  - Now also detects curses that don't follow standard poison/disease format
  - Checks for any note matching an item with curse/poison/disease trait
  - Fixes detection for curses like Witchflame and Debilitating Bite

- **Edited Affliction DC**: Chat save buttons now use current DC from edited afflictions
  - Previously, buttons in old chat messages used the DC from when the message was posted
  - Now checks for edited affliction definitions and uses current DC when rolling saves
  - Applies to both initial saves and stage saves
  - Ensures DC changes in the affliction editor are immediately reflected

- **Natural 1/20 Degree of Success**: Fixed degree of success calculation to account for natural 1s and 20s
  - Natural 20: Improves degree by one step (e.g., success → critical success)
  - Natural 1: Reduces degree by one step (e.g., success → failure)
  - Applies PF2e Core Rulebook rules correctly

- **Cleanse Affliction Spell**: Fixed to properly handle base vs heightened versions
  - Base (Rank 2): Now reduces stage by 1 without counteract check (only for stage 2+)
  - Reduction can only be applied once per affliction case (per rules)
  - Heightened (Rank 3): Counteract only for disease or poison
  - Heightened (Rank 4+): Counteract for curse, disease, or poison
  - Previous implementation incorrectly allowed counteract checks at all ranks
  - Example: DC 16, +15 modifier, roll nat 1 = total 16 → Now correctly counts as **Failure** (not Success)
  - Fixes both save confirmation messages and immediate application

### Changed

- **Condition System Architecture**: Migrated to PF2e GrantItem rule elements for condition management
  - Conditions now granted via GrantItem rules on affliction effects (native PF2e system)
  - Uses `onDeleteActions: { grantee: 'restrict' }` for built-in deletion prevention
  - PF2e natively handles multiple sources granting the same condition (highest value shown)
  - Automatic condition cleanup when affliction effect is removed
  - **Deleted ConditionStackingService.js entirely** - PF2e's GrantItem system handles all stacking natively
  - **Removed all condition protection hooks** - GrantItem handles deletion and update prevention
  - Deleted ~400 lines of custom condition stacking logic
  - Only remaining hook: GM badge→stage sync for manual control
  - More maintainable and aligned with PF2e's native architecture
  - Significant code reduction and performance improvement

- **Code Organization**: Refactored hook registration into modular file structure
  - Split monolithic `registration.js` (~900 lines) into focused modules
  - **New hooks/** directory: `damage.js`, `chat.js`, `combat.js`, `worldTime.js`, `tokenHUD.js`, `conditions.js`
  - **New handlers/** directory: `saveButtons.js`, `afflictionButtons.js`, `treatmentButtons.js`, `counteractButtons.js`, `chatButtons.js`
  - Main `registration.js` now acts as orchestrator (40 lines)
  - Improves maintainability, testability, and navigation
  - Each file has single, clear responsibility
  - Easier for developers to find and modify specific functionality

### Technical Details

- **New Files**:

## [1.0.0-alpha.4] - 2026-02-15

### Added

- **Storyframe Integration**: Optional integration with Storyframe module
  - New setting: "Integrate with Storyframe" (world, GM only)
  - When enabled, sends save and counteract rolls through Storyframe's pending roll system
  - Players receive roll prompts in Storyframe UI instead of chat buttons
  - Automatically falls back to chat buttons if player offline or Storyframe unavailable
  - Prompts GM to add actors as Storyframe participants if needed
  - Results processed via polling and routed to existing affliction handlers

## [1.0.0-alpha.3] - 2026-02-15

### Added

- **Condition Stacking (PF2e Rules)**: Implements official condition stacking rules
  - Tracks multiple condition instances with different values from different afflictions
  - Applies highest value when multiple sources exist
  - Automatically downgrades to next highest when top value expires
  - Example: slowed 2 (1 round) + slowed 1 (6 rounds) = slowed 2 for round 1, then slowed 1 for rounds 2-6
  - Stored in actor flags: `pf2e-afflictioner.conditionInstances`

- **Maximum Duration Expiration**: World time support for afflictions with maximum duration
  - Afflictions with max duration now expire correctly in both combat and world time
  - Combat: Uses elapsed rounds vs max duration
  - World time: Uses elapsed time vs max duration in seconds

- **Clickable Affliction Indicator**: Token names in indicator tooltip are now clickable
  - Click token name to open Affliction Manager filtered to that token
  - Tooltip stays visible when hovering over it
  - Improved hover behavior with 200ms delay

### Fixed

- **Duration Display**: Show durations in appropriate units instead of always minutes
  - Days for 24+ hours, hours for 1-23 hours, minutes for 1-59 minutes, seconds for < 1 minute
  - Applied to onset timers, save countdowns, and all duration displays
  - Example: "4320m" now shows as "3d"

- **Dice Roll Duration**: Fixed 1d4 rolling 0 due to Foundry v11+ async evaluation
  - Added fallback manual dice simulation when roll.evaluate() fails
  - Custom chat message ensures correct total is displayed

- **Onset Save Timing**: Fixed save prompts during onset period
  - No save prompts during onset - only when onset completes or stage duration expires
  - Added `inOnset` checks to both combat and world time save logic
  - Reset `durationElapsed` when onset completes to start stage duration fresh

- **World Time Save Prompts**: Always send chat prompts when saves are due during world time
  - Previously only sent if `autoPromptSaves` setting enabled
  - Now consistent with combat save behavior

- **Treatment Target Selection**: Treatment actions now use targeted tokens
  - Shows afflictions from targeted token(s), not all tokens
  - Falls back to all tokens if no targets selected

- **Affliction Editor (Foundry v13+ Compatibility)**:
  - Fixed FormDataExtended reference for Foundry v13+
  - Fixed TextEditor reference for Foundry v13+
  - Fixed form data extraction to handle flat structure (condition.0.name vs nested arrays)
  - Conditions, damage, and weakness now save correctly

- **Stage Change Edge Cases**:
  - Cap target stage when onset completes if affliction has fewer stages than expected
  - Prevents "Stage 2 not found" errors when afflictions are edited to have fewer stages

- **Affliction Indicator Display**: Show "Initial Save" instead of "Stage -1" for afflictions awaiting initial save

- **Backward Compatibility**: Conditions from old afflictions (before stacking service) are now cleaned up properly on removal

### Changed

- Treatment buttons now prioritize targeted tokens over all tokens on canvas

## [1.0.0-alpha.2] - 2026-02-14

### Added

- **Curse Affliction Support**: Full support for curse afflictions alongside poisons and diseases
  - Curse trait detection and parsing
  - Updated all UI elements to handle curses
  - Updated language strings and documentation

- **Virulent Trait (Official PF2e Rules)**:
  - Properly implements the virulent trait per Core Rulebook rules
  - Requires **two consecutive successful saves** to reduce stage by 1
  - Critical success reduces stage by only 1 (instead of 2)
  - Tracks consecutive success counter across saves
  - Shows notification when first success is achieved
  - Resets counter on failures or critical successes
  - UI badge shows `[Virulent]` with tooltip in Affliction Manager
  - Chat messages display virulent trait status and mechanics

- **Multiple Exposure (Official PF2e Rules)**:
  - **Poisons** (default behavior):
    - Failing initial save against new exposure increases stage by 1 (or 2 on critical failure)
    - Maximum duration remains unchanged
    - Works even during onset period (doesn't change onset length)
    - If no onset or already elapsed, immediately applies new stage effects
  - **Curses & Diseases** (default behavior):
    - Multiple exposures have no effect
    - Shows notification when re-exposed
  - **Custom Multiple Exposure Rules**:
    - Parses affliction-specific multiple exposure rules from item descriptions
    - Recognizes patterns like "Each additional exposure advances the stage by 2"
    - Supports minimum stage requirements (e.g., "when already at stage 2 or higher")
    - Custom rules override default behavior for all affliction types
  - UI badge shows `[Multiple Exposure +X]` with stage increase amount

- **UI Enhancements**:
  - Affliction Manager displays trait badges for virulent and multiple exposure
  - Chat save prompts show virulent trait warnings and mechanics
  - Tooltips explain trait effects on hover
  - Color-coded badges (virulent: orange, multiple exposure: blue)

- **New Language Strings**:
  - `MULTIPLE_EXPOSURE_NO_EFFECT_DEFAULT`: For curse/disease re-exposure
  - `POISON_RE_EXPOSURE`: For poison stage increase notification
  - `VIRULENT_CONSECUTIVE_SUCCESS`: First successful save against virulent affliction

- **Manual Affliction Entry**: Create custom afflictions directly via "Manual Entry" button
  - Prompts for name, type, DC, and number of stages
  - Creates template affliction that can be customized via editor

- **"OR" Damage Parsing**: Automatically detect and display damage choices
  - Parses patterns like "3d6 cold or fire damage"
  - Shows both options as clickable damage links
  - Vertical layout with "Choose one:" header for clarity

- **Counteract Button**: New button in Affliction Manager to counteract afflictions
  - Prompts for counteract rank and check result
  - Calculates affliction counteract rank (half level, rounded up)
  - Uses official counteract rules to determine success
  - Reduces stage by 1 on success, cures if at stage 1
  - Supports spells like Cleanse Affliction

- **Treat Poison/Disease Integration**: Automatic integration with native PF2e actions
  - Detects when Treat Poison/Treat Disease is used
  - Shows "Apply Treatment To:" buttons for matching afflictions
  - Automatically applies treatment bonus based on check result
  - Green-highlighted selection UI appears in chat

### Fixed

- **Max/Min Stage Bugs**:
  - Fixed incorrect "stage changed" notification when already at max/min stage
  - Added early return when stage doesn't actually change
  - Prevent misleading "Stage 2 (was Stage 2)" messages

- **Stage Button Controls**:
  - Disabled increase stage button when at maximum stage
  - Disabled decrease stage button when at stage 1
  - Added visual disabled state (30% opacity, grayed out)
  - Added tooltips for stage limits

- **Virulent Manual Control**:
  - Manual stage decrease now works immediately for virulent afflictions
  - GM has full control via buttons without consecutive success requirement
  - Virulent logic only applies to automatic save rolls

### Changed

- Treatment effect names now include result: "Affliction (Treatment: Critical Success)"
- Clearer labeling for treatment circumstance bonuses/penalties
- Reduced virulent tooltip text size to 85% for better fit
- Updated stage control logic to check limits before processing
- Updated all trait detection logic to include curse trait
- Updated `AFFLICTION_TYPES` constant to include `CURSE: 'curse'`
- Revised README.md to accurately describe PF2e affliction mechanics
- Updated settings hint to mention curse detection
