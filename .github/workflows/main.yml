# Troubleshooting Checklist:
#   - Is the module's manifest file valid JSON?
#     You can test your manifest file using https://jsonlint.com/.
#
#   - Does the module's manifest have all the required keys?
#     See https://foundryvtt.com/article/module-development/#manifest for more
#     information.
#
#   - Are all the proper files and directories being included in the release's
#     module archive ("module.zip")?
#     Check that the correct files are being passed to the `zip` command run
#     in the "Create Module Archive" step below.
#
#   - Is the release tag the proper format?
#     See the comments for the "Extract Version From Tag" step below.
#
#   - Is a GitHub release being published?
#     This workflow will only run when a release is published, not when a
#     release is updated. Furthermore, note that while a GitHub release will
#     (by default) create a repository tag, a repository tag will not create
#     or publish a GitHub release.
#
#   - Has the module's entry on FoundryVTT's module administration site
#     (https://foundryvtt.com/admin) been updated?
